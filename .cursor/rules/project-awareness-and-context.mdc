# Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read [PLANNING.md](mdc:PLANNING.md)** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check @TASKS.md** before starting a new task. If the task isnâ€™t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in [PLANNING.md](mdc:PLANNING.md).
