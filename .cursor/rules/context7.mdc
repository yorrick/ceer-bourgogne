# Context7 documentation

- Always use the Context7 MCP server to reference documentation for Libraries like Pulumi, FastAPI or Pydantic.
- For the tokens, start with 5000 but then increase to 20000 if your first search didn't give relevant documentation.
- Only search three times maximum for any specific piece of documentation. If you don't get what you need, use the Brave MCP server to perform a wider search.
