# Workflow Rules

Use port 3001 to run the local server, and run it with `npm run dev -- --port=3001`



- After EVERY change, use "npm run snapshot" to take a snapshot of the dashboard running locally. Store the snapshots in snapshots/
- Check snapshot to make sure feature has been implemented correctly
- If needed, simulate a scenario with Playwright to make sure feature works
